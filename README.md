# HAPPY TRAILS

Happy Trails is a CLI app that pulls and persists data from the U.S. National Parks Service. It allows the user to search for and find National Parks, discover information about those parks, and visit them on the web.

Happy Trails also allows users to add parks to a list of parks that they have visited, or to a list of parks that they would like to visit in the future. And when they log back in, those lists will be there waiting for them.


## Instructions

In Terminal, change directories into Happy Trails' root directory.

Happy Trails requires a number of Ruby gems, including:

"sinatra-activerecord"
"sqlite3"
"pry"
"require_all"
'rest-client'
'json'
'launchy'
'tty-prompt'

Before you run Happy Trails for the first time, run the command 'bundle install' in terminal to make sure that that the application runs as intended.

Once that's done, to run the application, run the command 'ruby bin/run.rb' in terminal.

When the application opens, enter your name and enjoy!
